## Getting Start for Shali

it is so simple! just clone project, install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) and then run
`pipenv install` after that, if you want to install another packege(i've already install flask)
please tell me befor that, if i'm not on-call, simply use `pipenv install PACKAGE`. don't forget to use
`pipenv uninstall PACKAGE` for package that we don't want them anymore.

i try to work on it on this weekend. have fun
